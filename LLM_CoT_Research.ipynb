In this case the intended output ended with the line `print(result)`, and everything after that (i.e `Student: a company has ...` onwards)  is gibberish.\n",

We'll also need some code to extract the numerical answer from the intended output, regardless if it's instruction tuned or not.\n",

Also there are sometimes many types of cases to consider since the model doesn't always follow a rigid pattern.
