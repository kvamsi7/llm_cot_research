This is where you'll find most of the models and datasets you'll use in your research. The code here can largely be reused for the datasets that you'll download in your own research.\n",

        "A summary of GSM8K from their official repo: State-of-the-art language models can match human performance on many tasks, but they still struggle to robustly perform multi-step mathematical reasoning. To diagnose the failures of current models and support research, we're releasing GSM8K, a **dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems**. We find that even the largest transformer models fail to achieve high test performance, despite the conceptual simplicity of this problem distribution.\n",

Using GPT4 with prompting, self consistency, and tool-use (e.g prompting the LLM to output Python code and then connecting it to a code interpreter that can execute the code), we can achieve above 95% accuracy: [source](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/arithmetic-reasoning-on-gsm8k).\n",
